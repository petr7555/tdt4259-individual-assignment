I would recommend checking both templates first and then finalizing the project you are going to pick up for this assignment. It will give you an idea about if the project you are choosing can be easily broken down into those points.

. It can even be a hypothetical company/problem
Use open-source data/problems, or even hypothetical ones.

  Approximately 10 pages

- You do not need to do the data analysis, just design the solution and fill up the template provided for that.

- one-pager and a design document for a data science project = data-driven problem that you can solve, theoretically. It can range anywhere from adding a new feature to an already existing product to designing a full-fledged new product
- theoretical assignment – no data analysis is needed
- You can choose any project: an open-source project, or even a hypothetical one, as long as you can break it down and are able to write both the one-pager and design document for the same. You can get creative and make a hypothetical company that is going to release your dream product. So, you have the liberty to be creative.

## Design doc
For the design document,  it makes sense to write it for the data science and/or data engineer team. I would suggest writing both (one pager and design doc) for the same audience to keep the report coherent.

Thinking deeply comes with writing the design doc.
To propose a good design, you have to research and understand the problem space.
**Focus on what you and others need to know before implementing the system; share enough detail so others
can provide meaningful feedback.**
Distributing and getting feedback on design docs is also easier.
Writing is still a cheap way to ensure we **solve the right problems in the right way**. They save money by helping teams avoid rabbit holes or **building systems that aren’t used**. They also help align stakeholders, improve initial ideas, and scale knowledge.
